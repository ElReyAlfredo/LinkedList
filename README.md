# Data Structures Study Repository

Hi Everyone 👋

I'm studying data structures, and this is my personal repository. Here, you'll find a variety of methods and implementations for different types of data structures.

The methods range from basic operations to more complex ones. If you're someone who wants to understand how these fundamental concepts work from scratch, this is for you.

LinkedList:

### 🧩 Basic Operations

These are the most essential ones; every linked list should have them:

- addBeginning(value) Inserts a node at the beginning of the list.
- addLast(value) Inserts a node at the end of the list.
- deleteFirst() Removes the first node (the head).
- deleteLast() Removes the last node.
- findNode(value) Searches for the first node containing the specified value.
- displayList() Displays all nodes in order (useful for debugging).
- isEmpty() Returns true if the list is empty.
- getHead() Returns the first node.
- getTail() Returns the last node.

### ⚙️ Intermediate Operations

More useful when you want to manipulate specific positions or values:

- insertAfter(targetValue, newValue) Inserts a new node after the node with targetValue.
- insertBefore(targetValue, newValue) Inserts a new node before the node with targetValue.
- insertAt(index, value) Inserts a new node at a specific position.
- deleteValue(value) Deletes the first node containing that value.
- deleteAt(index) Deletes the node at a specific position.
- getAt(index) Returns the node at the specified position.
- setAt(index, value) Modifies the value of the node at a certain position.
